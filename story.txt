Aquaman went into the bar bleeding all the way through the floor.
 He told the bar tender that he forgot to bring his trident. "You are not the one true king!" shouted the people in the bar.
Someone says, "Watch out! Here is your trident!". Aquaman looked around but did not see any people around. Maybe he was dreaming. 
Suddenly his trident appeared as if out of thin air. Aquaman looked again to see if it might have been placed there by someone but
the bar was still empty. There was a sickenig silence. Suddenly Aquaman found that he could not breathe.
