Aquaman went into the bar bleeding all the way through the floor. He told the bar tender that he forgot to bring his trident. "You are not the one true king!" shouted the people in the bar.
Someone says, "Watch out! Here is your trident!". Aquaman looked around but did not see any people around. Maybe he was dreaming. 
Hey!  Over here!  AntMan was on his shoulder.  Aquaman said "You don't belong in this universe!"  AntMan replied, "Yeah, probably not.  Bye!"
